# Diploi Launches Unified Cloud Development & Deployment Platform for Agile Teams

**Helsinki, Finland – November 20, 2025**

**Diploi** today announced their new all-in-one platform that combines the one-click deployment ease of services like Vercel and Netlify with the power of cloud development environments like Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces. A platform tailored for startups, development agencies, and freelancers, that streamlines how web apps, APIs and microservices are built, from coding to cloud, allowing teams to build, test, and deploy applications without spending time setting up and managing infrastructure. 

Founded in 2024 by a Finnish team of experienced software engineers, Diploi started as a solution to a problem they had themselves while working at [Nemesys Oy](https://nemesys.fi/). Software development agencies working with different clients in parallel, struggle with the fact that each client project is independent from other projects, which means that:

- All knowledge, dependencies and infrastructure for each project stay siloed
- Context switching is difficult since each project requires its own custom environment configuration
- Collaboration is slowed down due to compatibility issues between the development environments of each developer
- Onboarding for each project is unique and time-consuming
- Infrastructure and deployment management become harder to maintain for each project

Diploi eliminates these pains by first allowing users to start new projects with a scaffold app stack, which comes with a ready-to-code cloud environment and fully managed hosting out of the box. Users can start coding in their browser or connect their favorite IDE via SSH, and get their app online instantly. The result is an experience where code runs in the same way for all developers involved on a project, regardless of their local environment, eliminating the “works on my machine” problem and skipping any need for manual server configuration when it comes to deployment.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Frictionless Onboarding:** Developers can be productive in minutes with zero local setup. Diploi’s built-in cloud development environments ensure everyone uses the same stack and configurations, eliminating environment mismatch errors. Team members can start coding by simply accepting an invite to a project, without the need for local package installations or Dockerfiles to debug.

- **Effortless Project Handoff:** Agencies and freelancers can hand off projects to clients by granting access to the projects hosted on Diploi. Clients’ tech teams can take over immediately, without needing to configure AWS, Azure, or Docker manually. Everything needed to run and scale the application is already bundled and version-controlled.

- **One-Click Deployments, Any Stack:** Diploi makes deployment feel like a Git push. Users can launch full-stack applications, from Django and Laravel to FastAPI, Supabase, n8n, Ghost, Bun, and more, with a few clicks. The platform provisions infrastructure, sets up SSL certificates, and provides custom domain support, all without needing to touch Kubernetes or cloud consoles.

- **Consistent Dev & Prod Environments:** Every project runs in isolated cloud containers with remote access. Teams can create staging and preview environments for every branch or feature, which come with an integrated CI/CD by default and allow testing before production.

- **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing:** Unlike other platforms that charge monthly per-seat or per-service fees, Diploi only charges for usage, based on the time your deployments are active. Pricing starts at €0.026/hour, and users can pause environments when not needed. There are no additional fees.

## Bridging Development and Deployment for Teams

Diploi’s all-in-one approach addresses a growing need in the industry: a single platform where coding, testing, and deployment co-exist seamlessly.

The team believes that developers shouldn’t need to manage a dozen tools or be DevOps experts to get an app running in the cloud. By combining coding and hosting into one smooth experience, developers can spin up a new project, code with their team in a cloud development environment, and deploy to a production environment with one click.

This workflow allows teams to achieve significant time savings, easier onboarding, and smoother collaboration. Diploi supports shared environments, real-time code previews, GitHub imports, and even importing AI-generated apps from Lovable.

## The New European Landscape Opportunity for Diploi

Diploi, headquartered in Finland, is well-positioned to benefit from Europe’s renewed focus on data sovereignty and technological independence. As one of the few developer tools and cloud hosting platforms based entirely in the European Union, Diploi is uniquely suited to serve companies that prioritize EU-based infrastructure and compliance. This presents a significant opportunity for growth, both across Europe and globally, as more organizations seek trusted, regional alternatives to US-centric platforms.
